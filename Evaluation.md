# Evaluation
The evaluation of the project at this state of development is poor of informations due to the lack of the prototype and the application. The first will used to measure the effective consume of energy and performance of the network. The second one will used to analyze the informations by end users' point of view.

We will have some constraints to give particular attention, like battery or bandwidth.
We expect a low energy power consume and a fast connection for the data ( it's necessary that the network communicates with a good performance to give information in real time). Also we don't want that the cycle of duties engraves on battery so we want that the system upgrades the status of the parking a limited number of time.

The only thing that we can say, at this time, is the estimation of the cost of prototype that it rounds at 20 euros.

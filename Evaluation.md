# Evaluation
The evaluation of the project at this state of development is poor of informations due to the lack of the prototype, to measure the effective consume of energy and performance of the network, and the lack of the app to analyze the information by end users' point of view.

We expect a low energy power consume and a fast connection for the data ( it's necessary that the network communicates with a good performance to give informations in real time). Also we don't want that the cycle of duties engraves on battery so we want that the system upgrades the status of the parking a certain number of time.

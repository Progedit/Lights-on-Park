# Concept

## Introduction

Lights on Parking is a project created to monitor the availability of parking spaces and consequently, if they are free, indicate them to the citizen through an app / web page, optimizing the traffic of those looking for a lot.

## Open Impact 

As a starting point for the project we took into consideration one of the themes offered by the Open Impact platform, namely Urban Regeneration, specifically the section relating to Sustainable Transport. We believe that our idea can provide a “smart” solution to a problem that is certainly very present in a chaotic city like Rome, that of parking.

## Study Area

We have chosen to focus our studio in a very specific area, familiar to us, Via delle Sette Sale, near our university, La Sapienza, with the possibility in the future to extend it throughout the city. In fact, we usually have to go around looking for a parking space in that area for a long time, risking being late and creating unnecessary "traffic". In these cases, it would be useful to have an application that indicates an available parking space near your area.

## The device

Our device revolves around an ultrasonic sensor, which is positioned under the asphalt, in the center of the parking space, in such a way as to allow maximum efficiency.
Communication with the user takes place via a web page / app, which indicates the places available in a specific area.

## Requirements

We have extrapolated the following requirements from a google form that we have submit to a randoms people who lives in different places: a little city, a big city or a suburban area of a city. 

The requirements are:

- Possibility of giving the citizen a smart way to search for parking spaces.

This graphic is relative to a request of an new app that give the possibility to search and find a parking space before that we arrive in the specific zone. Almost the ninety percent of the persons have given a positive response.

- The driver, with Lights on parking, already knowing where to park, reduces his time inside the car, devoting the time purchased to something else.

In this graph, roughly 50% of users spend between 30 minutes and an hour searching for parking,while 25% take more than an hour and the remaining less than 30 minutes. 


- The reduction of traffic and congestion.

- Lower consumption of fuel and therefore the reduction of ambiental pollution but also the lower waste of money on fuel.

The next graph is one of the many graphs that tell us how environmental pollution is growing from year to year, reaching historic peaks in recent years.

- Lights on Parking can also benefit the driver's mood. We have found that searching for a parking space is stressful and counterproductive to the vast majority of users. It also affects the driver's punctuality, especially in the workplace.

The two previous graphs show that the search for a parking space is stressful for the interviewed users, in the first when you go to work or where you study and in the other when you go out for leisure.

While this other graph looks like the search for a parking space, it can affect the punctuality of the user.

DEVICE REQUIREMENTS

In the diagram below we show how our device is better than the other two,that are a top video camera installed on the light pole and a pole installed on the sidewalk with an ultrasonic sensor.

Our device:
- Respect the privacy of users.
- Not exposed to vandalism or bad weather.
- It does not need frequent maintenance.
- Not dangerous for pedestrians, cyclists, etc.

The following graph shows that most users prefer an invisible device over a visible one.

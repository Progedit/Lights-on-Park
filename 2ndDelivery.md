# 2nd Delivery

## Comments received during the 1st delivery

### 1. Not extend the project and to focus on the parking problem
Initially we had thought of creating a double functionality, both that of smart parking and that of street lighting, but we were advised to focus exclusively on the parking part for the moment.

### 2. Requirements
In the first delivery, the project requirements were too general and bland. We did not focus on a particular study area but on huge cities.

### 3. Accuracy

### 4. Storyboard and personas
The use of storyboards and personas was wrong, and we had to use them better for identify the requirements.

# Concept
With our group project we are focused about the problems of the cities and in particular about how we can resolve these problems with the help of Internet of Things in order to realize a smart city, so it is connected to Open Impact in the scope of “Urban Regeneration”.
A smart city is an urban area in which, thanks to the use of digital technologies and more generally of technological innovation, it is possible to optimize and improve the infrastructures and services to citizens, making them more efficient.

### General View

In particular we are focused on the Sustainable Transportation, in fact the project is born with the idea of to provide to the users a smart way to find parking lots: nowadays in highly populated cities finding a free parking space can be really complicated, and this problem can cause in addition to waste of time, unnecessary congestion of the roads that could be solved if only a person knew that in that area there are no parking spaces, so as to head directly to another area. In particular we thought to equip every parking lot in the city with a IoT device in order to map the situation, so in order to understand if the lot is free or not. In this way, the user can interact with the system by means of a web app and to know the situation of a certain part of the town, as so as to deduce whether or not he could find a parking space in that area before leaving for that destination.

### Prototype

The IoT device in question is placed on a pole, place beside the parking lot on the sidewalk. In this way on the one hand the device provides parking control as explained above, on the other hand it provides another useful service for citizens: a smart lighting system thanks to which the sidewalk is illuminated when a pedestrian passes by the pole.

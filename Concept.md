### General View

In particular we are focused on the Sustainable Transportation, in fact the project is born with the idea of to provide to the users a smart way to find parking lots: nowadays in highly populated cities finding a free parking space can be really complicated, and this problem can cause in addition to waste of time, unnecessary congestion of the roads that could be solved if only a person knew that in that area there are no parking spaces, so as to head directly to another area. In particular we thought to equip every parking lot in the city with a IoT device in order to map the situation, so in order to understand if the lot is free or not. In this way, the user can interact with the system by means of a web app and to know the situation of a certain part of the town, as so as to deduce whether or not he could find a parking space in that area before leaving for that destination.

### Prototype

The IoT device in question is placed on a pole, place beside the parking lot on the sidewalk. In this way on the one hand the device provides parking control as explained above, on the other hand it provides another useful service for citizens: a smart lighting system thanks to which the sidewalk is illuminated when a pedestrian passes by the pole.

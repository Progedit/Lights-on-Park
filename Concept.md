# Concept

## **Introduction**

Lights on Parking is a project created to monitor the availability of parking spaces and consequently, if they are free, indicate them to the citizen through an app / web page, optimizing the traffic of those looking for a lot.

## **Open Impact** 

As a starting point for the project we took into consideration one of the themes offered by the Open Impact platform, namely Urban Regeneration, specifically the section relating to Sustainable Transport. We believe that our idea can provide a “smart” solution to a problem that is certainly very present in a chaotic city like Rome, that of parking.

## **Study Area**

We have chosen to focus our studio in a very specific area, familiar to us, Via delle Sette Sale, near our university, La Sapienza, with the possibility in the future to extend it throughout the city. In fact, we usually have to go around looking for a parking space in that area for a long time, risking being late and creating unnecessary "traffic". In these cases, it would be useful to have an application that indicates an available parking space near your area.

## **The device**

Our device revolves around an ultrasonic sensor, which is positioned under the asphalt, in the center of the parking space, in such a way as to allow maximum efficiency.
Communication with the user takes place via a web page / app, which indicates the places available in a specific area.

## **Requirements**

We have extrapolated the following requirements from a google form and from the personas and storyboards methods:

- Possibility of giving the citizen a smart way to search for parking spaces.

- The motorist, with Lights on parking, already knowing where to park, reduces his time inside the car, devoting the time purchased to something else.

- The reduction of traffic and congestion.

- Consequence of the previous requirement is the lower consumption of fuel and therefore the reduction of environmental pollution and also the lower waste of money on fuel.

- Also Lights on Parking can also benefit the driver's mood. We have found that searching for a parking space is stressful and counterproductive to the vast majority of users.

The requirements of our device are illustrated in the following picture:

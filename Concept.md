# Concept

## Introduction

Lights on Parking is a project created to monitor the availability of parking spaces and consequently, if they are free, indicate them to the citizen through an app / web page, optimizing the traffic of those looking for a lot.

## Open Impact 

As a starting point for the project we took into consideration one of the themes offered by the Open Impact platform, namely Urban Regeneration, specifically the section relating to Sustainable Transport. We believe that our idea can provide a “smart” solution to a problem that is certainly very present in a chaotic city like Rome, that of parking.

## Study Area

We have chosen to focus our studio in a very specific area, familiar to us, Via delle Sette Sale, near our university, La Sapienza, with the possibility in the future to extend it throughout the city. In fact, we usually have to go around looking for a parking space in that area for a long time, risking being late and creating unnecessary "traffic". In these cases, it would be useful to have an application that indicates an available parking space near your area.

## The device

Our device revolves around an ultrasonic sensor, which is positioned under the asphalt, in the center of the parking space, in such a way as to allow maximum efficiency.
Communication with the user takes place via a web page / app, which indicates the places available in a specific area.

## Requirements

We have extrapolated the following requirements from a google form that we have submit to a randoms people who lives in different places: a little city, a big city or a suburban area of a city. 

The requirements are:

- Possibility of giving the citizen a smart way to search for parking spaces.

This graphic is relative to a request of an new app that give the possibility to search and find a parking space before that we arrive in the specific zone. Almost the ninety percent of the persons have given a positive response.

- The driver, with Lights on parking, already knowing where to park, reduces his time inside the car, devoting the time purchased to something else.

- The reduction of traffic and congestion.

- Lower consumption of fuel and therefore the reduction of ambiental pollution but also the lower waste of money on fuel.

- Lights on Parking can also benefit the driver's mood. We have found that searching for a parking space is stressful and counterproductive to the vast majority of users. It also affects the driver's punctuality, especially in the workplace.

The two previous graphs show that the search for a parking space is stressful for the interviewed users, in the first when you go to work or where you study and in the other when you go out for leisure.

The requirements of our device are illustrated in the following picture:

# Brief Description
This is a project about IoT (Internet of Things). The scope of the project is give to citizens to take informations about free slots park and, at the same time, have a good illumination of the sidewalks.
In a city, like Rome, there are many problems about traffic and parking. We try to give a solution concerning these problems, building a system composed by two components: one of these is referred to track the empty slots of parking and the other is related to illuminate the sidewalks next to the street. The IoT system that we propose uses two sensors to take informations about cars and pedestrains.
